# UF-API_GROUP (Calculator API Branch)

This branch is for the development of the Calculator API. This api takes in a json object with two numbers, x and y, and returns the result of the selected operation. The current functions supported are addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, modulo, exponentials, roots, and logarithms.

Note: The API is working as is.
